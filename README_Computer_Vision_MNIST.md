# Computer Vision Example with MNIST Dataset

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is an example of deep learning applied to computer vision, using the MNIST dataset. It is designed as a companion notebook for the book "Deep Learning with Python, Second Edition." This notebook focuses on runnable code blocks and practical implementation of concepts discussed in the book.

## Key Concepts
- **Introduction to Deep Learning for Computer Vision**: Basic principles of deep learning as applied to image recognition tasks.
- **Working with the MNIST Dataset**: A hands-on approach to dealing with the classic MNIST dataset, known for handwritten digit recognition tasks.
- **Building and Training Models**: Step-by-step guide to building neural network models using TensorFlow and Keras and training them with the MNIST dataset.

## Technologies and Libraries
- TensorFlow 2.6
- Keras
- Other supporting Python libraries for data handling and visualization.

## Installation
Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.6 keras
# Add any other necessary package installations here
```

## Usage
Run the `chapter08_Computer Vision ex1 (MNIST).ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment. The notebook is well-commented, making it easy to follow along with the book and understand each step in deep learning model development.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow 2.6 and Keras
